## Blaschke-Decomposition(Python)
---
> **The Matlab version of the program is derived from [Hau-Tieng Wu](https://github.com/hautiengwu/BlaschkeDecomposition) **
---
Contribution of this project:
[1] Blaschke decomposition based on python (non-numerical analytical solver).
[2] Partial implementation of BKD decomposition based on added carriers.
[3] Python version of instantaneous phase implementation for time-frequency analysis
---
### Applications

Modal extraction of non-stationary signals is achieved by BKD for applications such as WVD to remove cross-terms and for higher quality signal analysis needs.
